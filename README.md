This is a small example of getting up and running on learning Blockchain technology using Ethereum and
related technologies.

### Eureka! moment
#### If you plan to just browse and not pull code and run, here are some key takaeways:
- This example use Nodejs ecosystem such as Nodejs libraries

- An Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) is a container with an RPC interface and the deployment unit
is a *contract*
- Ethereum contracts are strongly typed thus compiler enforces interfaces and types at compile time.
- ABI stands for Application Binary Interface.

### Key Takeaways
- Ethereum Dapps require *gas* to deploy and run, so the business model of blockchain is that participants need to pay in support the network
- A block chain is an immutable and append only log where the data structure is a *block*. A block has
a header with cryptographic semantics with a pointer to any previous blocks.
